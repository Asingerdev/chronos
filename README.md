# Chronos

## Introduction

Chronos is a full-stack React/Flask application where the user is able to create timelines of any event that happened historically. 

## Homepage

On the landing page, users can sign up or log into the site, and they will see all of the existing timelines that have been created by other users. Once logged in, users can view other people's timeline, or create their own timelines to contribute to the community. 

## Timelines

On each timeline's page, users see a list of all the events in that timeline in chronological order. If the user created that timeline, they can add, delete, or edit events on it. 

## Events

Each event includes information not only about the title and date of the event, but also a quick summary and links to videos, pictures or infographics that correspond to the event. 

## Future Versions

In future versions we would like to integrate the MediaWiki API in order to extract summaries of events from Wikipedia to include in the summary section of the events. 

## Technologies Used

React, Flask, Peewee, SQLite, Playhouse, bcrypt, Styled Components
